# Katana

Katana is a simple BEM code inspired by BYU CCBlade

## Appendix

- Currently Katana only works for wind turbines

- Katana can perform analysis of flow conditions where the incoming velocity is > 0, and when the turbine rotational velocity (and thus tip speed ratio) is > 0. No inflow angles less than 0 degrees can be resolved by this code.

- Currently there is no provision for turbine precone angles

- No Mach number corrections are applied in this analysis

- Tip/Hub losses are computed using method outlined by Prandtl (Glauert, H., Airplane propellers, Aerodynamic Theory, Springer, 1935, pp. 169â€“360.)

- Reynolds number corrections are computed as demonstrated in [Ning, Computational Aerodynamics, pp. 219](https://byu.box.com/shared/static/ywfayozbj3sr2ot6b32u8nqk5brqvurt.pdf)

- The Snell method is applied for rotational corrections to the lift coefficient and Eggers method is used for rotational corrections to the drag coefficient. See [Ning, Computational Aerodynamics, pp. 217 - 218](https://byu.box.com/shared/static/ywfayozbj3sr2ot6b32u8nqk5brqvurt.pdf)
